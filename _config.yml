  Hi, my name is Je-Eon Bae and I am undergraduate student at Kyung Hee University. My goal is to make deep learning technology more accessible and allow individuals from diverse backgrounds to benefit from its potential.
  
  Currently, my research is focused on two specific areas: <mark>Semi-,Self-supervised Learning</mark> and <mark>Model Compression</mark>. I am interested in improving the trade-off between the training cost and model performance in these areas, which can help to make deep learning more accessible to humans.

#           I started this project as a way if learning <mark>React</mark> and it has since grown into a fully fledged app. I have learned many skills through this and been I'm very proud of having this in my portfolio. If you don't have a project as awesome as this I would advise you make one.
