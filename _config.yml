  Hi, I'm Je-Eon Bae, a Ph.D.student in Artificial Intelligence at [Postech](https://ai.postech.ac.kr/).
  
  I am passionate about using machine learning to maximize economic and societal value. 
  To achieve this goal, I am researching ways to make machine learning more user-friendly and practical so that people from all walks of life can benefit from its potential.
  
  Currently, my research is focused on two specific areas: <mark>Data-efficient Learning</mark> and <mark>Interpretable neural networks</mark>.

#           I started this project as a way if learning <mark>React</mark> and it has since grown into a fully fledged app. I have learned many skills through this and been I'm very proud of having this in my portfolio. If you don't have a project as awesome as this I would advise you make one.
