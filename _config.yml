  Hi, my name is Je-Eon Bae and I am undergraduate student at Kyung Hee University. My goal is to make deep learning technology more accessible and allow individuals from diverse backgrounds to benefit from its potential.
  
  Currently, my research is focused on two specific areas: <mark>Semi-supervised Learning</mark> and <mark>Self-supervised Learning</mark>. I am interested in improving the trade-off between the cost of training and model performance in these areas, which can help to make deep learning more accessible to humans.

#           I started this project as a way if learning <mark>React</mark> and it has since grown into a fully fledged app. I have learned many skills through this and been I'm very proud of having this in my portfolio. If you don't have a project as awesome as this I would advise you make one.

         As an undergraduate at Kyung Hee University, I pursued a major in Industrial Engineering, building a strong mathematical foundation in subjects that are crucial for understanding deep learning theory, including optimization, probability and statistics, and linear algebra. I also earned a degree in Software Engineering, which equipped me with the necessary skills to implement deep learning algorithms.
