  Hi, my name is jeeon and I am undergraduate student at Kyung Hee University. My ultimate goal is to make deep learning technology more accessible and allow individuals from diverse backgrounds to benefit from its potential.
  
  Currently, my research is focused on two specific areas: <mark>semi-supervised learning</mark> and <mark>explainable AI</mark>. I am interested in improving the trade-off between the cost of training and model performance in these areas, which can help to make deep learning more accessible to humans.
